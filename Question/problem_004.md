## AtCoder Beginner Contest 439

### Problem Statement
You are given an integer *N*. Compute and output the value of $2^N-2N$.

### Constraints
- *N* is an integer between 1 and 11, inclusive.

### Input
The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
```csharp
N
```

### Output
Output the answer.

### Sample Input 1
```csharp
1
```

### Sample Output 1

0
```

The value of *N* given in this input is 1, so output the value of $2^1-2×1$, which is 0.

### Sample Input 2
```csharp
2
```

### Sample Output 2
```csharp
0
```

The value of *N* given in this input is 2, so output the value of $2^2-2×2$, which is 0.

### Sample Input 3
```csharp
11
```

### Sample Output 3
```csharp
2026
```

The value of *N* given in this input is 11, so output the value of $2^{11}-2×11$, which is 2026.
